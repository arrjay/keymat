KeyMat
======

The scripts here are for making paper keybooks to easily handle offline gpg
keys. It will create two books (public, private) with two different impositions
(single-sided, double-sided) for printing. The idea is to print these two
documents and lock them in a safe or bank vault as an escrow key pair.
