KeyMat
======

The scripts here are for making paper keybooks to easily handle offline gpg
keys. It will create two books (public, private) with two different impositions
(single-sided, double-sided) for printing. The idea is to print these two
documents and lock them in a safe or bank vault as an escrow key pair.

Folding the documents
---------------------

For the double sided PDF, fold on the short side, bringing 02 and 03 together.
Fold again on the new short side, bringing 04 and 05 together. Finally, bring
08  and 09 together. Staple 08/09 fold, and cut all page edges free.

For the single sided PDF, prefold on the long side in the center, and on the
short sides between each row. Leave folded on short center, and cut on the
long fold until the short fold - between 13/06 and 14/05.  Add the other long
folds now - between 02/03 and 16/01 all the way down the long side. Unfold, then
refold on center long fold. Cut the two edge short folds  - between 09/06 +
10/13 and 14/01 + 05/02 - it should look like a pair of window shutters if you
did this correctly. Bring 12/13 and 06/07 together - that is, opening the
window with printed sides against each other. Bring 13/14 and 05/06 together.
At this point you should not see any text. Then flip up each edge, bringing
11/12, 16/17 together. Finally, pull 03 and 16 towards each other, allowing
01/02 and 09/10 to 'stick out' like an accordian. Finally, you should be able
to wrap pages 01/16 around to form a book. Fasten between 08/09 and you should
be done.
